# A React-Django application

These are basically two projects that need to run separately.

In a terminal or console window, go to the `project` directory and run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.

In another terminal or console window, go to the `myapp` directory and run `npm start` to start the React application. It should automatically open up a new browser window and show the ten messages from the database in the Django application.
